## Welcome to the VIDGER Pipeline

### About
ViDGER (**Vi**sualization of **D**ifferential **G**ene **E**xpression using **R**), is a web-based tool for the analysis of RNA-seq count data. This toolâ€™s purpose is to provide users with a comprehensive and user-friendly method for performing differential gene expression (DGE) analysis regardless of their computational experience. ViDGER also has integrated experimental design options to cater to users with non-traditional DGE requirements, such as interaction terms or paired data. This tool is designed in a way for usable results to be generated in around one minute or for users to invest more time into detailed investigations of their data. ViDGER is a **user-friendly** and **interactive** Shiny app for gene expression analysis. This app takes advantage of several popular DGE tools (*DESeq2*, *edgeR*, and *limma*) available through Bioconductor in conjunction with the Plotly and DataTable API libraries for R. ViDGER also contains an R package which can produce information-rich visualizations for the interpretation of differential gene expression results from three widely-used tools, *Cuffdiff*, *DESeq2*, and *edgeR*.

### Submit and QC
To use this app, all you need to upload is two CSV files: a file of raw read counts and another file for sample treatment data. For further information of how these files should look like, take a look at the demonstration data or go to the help section for a detailed walk through.

### Preliminary Analysis
After you have submitted your data, you can analyze the correlation between any treatment sample combination, discover which genes have the highest average expression, plot individual genes and their respective counts, and potentially discover biclusters in your experimental data.

### DGE Analysis
To determine the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), you currently have the option of using 3 Bioconductor packages mentioned in the prior sections. DEGs can be visualized using common techniques, including volcano plots, MA plots, and heat maps. Additionally, DGE data sets can be downloaded as CSV files for further analysis in this section.
